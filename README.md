# C Programming

A course that introduces you to the fundamentals of programming in C.

We will start with the basics of computer science and then we will learn how to get started with programming in C. Beginners should get the hang of the basics very quickly. Also, through the course, we will expand our knowledge with all the prerequisites you will need to become a good developer. All the work will be accompanied by a talk about computer architecture and the complexity of algorithms and how different structures are implemented in the background and what they serve for. At the end of the course, the idea is that everyone has a very good foundation for further progress.
